## Quick Start

Install uv-release and scaffold your first workflow:

```bash
uv add --dev uv-release-monorepo
uvr workflow init
```

Check what would be released:

```bash
uvr release --dry-run
```

Release changed packages. Generates a plan, prompts for confirmation, and dispatches to GitHub Actions.

```bash
uvr release
```

That's it. One CLI, one workflow file, one command to ship. See the [setup guide](/user-guide/01-getting-started) for the full walkthrough.
