# Customizing the Pipeline

## Custom workflow jobs

The generated `release.yml` has five core jobs. Add your own by editing the YAML directly and wiring them via `needs`.

### Tests before build

```yaml
checks:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: ${{ !contains(fromJSON(inputs.plan).skip, 'checks') }}
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v6
    - run: uv sync --all-packages
    - run: uv run poe check
    - run: uv run poe test

build:
  needs: [checks]
  # ... (rest unchanged)
```

### Slack notifications

```yaml
notify:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [bump]
  if: ${{ always() && !failure() && !cancelled() }}
  steps:
    - name: Notify Slack
      env:
        UVR_PLAN: ${{ inputs.plan }}
      run: |
        CHANGED=$(echo "$UVR_PLAN" | jq -r '.changed | keys | join(", ")')
        curl -X POST "$SLACK_WEBHOOK" -d "{\"text\": \"Released: $CHANGED\"}"
```

### Accessing the plan

The full release plan JSON is available as <code v-pre>${{ inputs.plan }}</code>. Use `fromJSON(inputs.plan)` in expressions.

```yaml
if: fromJSON(inputs.plan).changed['my-package'] != null
env:
  VERSION: ${{ fromJSON(inputs.plan).changed['my-package'].release_version }}
```

### Tips

- Add <code v-pre>if: ${{ !contains(fromJSON(inputs.plan).skip, '&lt;job-name&gt;') }}</code> so your job can be skipped with `--skip`.
- Use `always() && !failure() && !cancelled()` for jobs after skippable upstream jobs.
- Run <code class="brand-code">uvr workflow validate</code> after editing.

## Python hooks

Create `uvr_hooks.py` at your workspace root.

```python
from uv_release import Hooks


class MyHooks(Hooks):
    def post_plan(self, workspace, intent, plan):
        # Inspect the plan before dispatch
        return plan
```

### Local hooks

Run on your machine during <code class="brand-code">uvr release</code>.

| Method | Signature | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `pre_plan` | `(self, workspace, intent)` | Modified intent or `None` |
| `post_plan` | `(self, workspace, intent, plan)` | Modified plan or `None` |

### CI hooks

Run during executor phases (in GitHub Actions or locally with `--where local`).

| Method | When |
|---|---|
| `pre_build` / `post_build` | Before/after the build phase |
| `pre_release` / `post_release` | Before/after GitHub release creation |
| `pre_publish` / `post_publish` | Before/after index publishing |
| `pre_bump` / `post_bump` | Before/after the version bump phase |

### Attaching custom data to the plan

The plan is a frozen model, so `post_plan` cannot mutate it. To attach custom data, build a new plan with the extra fields.

```python
def post_plan(self, workspace, intent, plan):
    # Log or inspect the plan
    print(f"Releasing {len(plan.jobs)} jobs")
    return plan
```

The full plan JSON is available in workflow jobs via `fromJSON(inputs.plan)`.
