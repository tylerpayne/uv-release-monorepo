# Post-releases

Post-releases publish a corrected version of an already-released package without bumping the version number. They follow [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#post-releases) versioning.

## Usage

```bash
uvr release --post
# → 1.2.3.post0
```

## How it works

1. uvr strips the `.devN` suffix from each changed package's version to get the base `X.Y.Z`
2. It scans existing git tags to find the next available post-release number
3. The published version becomes `X.Y.Z.post0` (or `.post1`, etc.)
4. After release, the pyproject.toml version is bumped to `X.Y.Z.post1.dev0` (dev toward the next post-release)

## Version ordering

Post-releases sort after the final release but before the next version:

```
1.0.1 < 1.0.1.post0 < 1.0.1.post1 < 1.0.2.dev0 < 1.0.2
```

## Auto-incrementing

The post-release number auto-increments by scanning existing tags. If `my-pkg/v1.2.3.post0` already exists, the next `--post` release will produce `1.2.3.post1`.

## When to use

- **Hotfix for a released version**: a critical bug needs to be patched on an older release while main has moved on. Check out the release tag, fix, and publish with `--post`.
- **Packaging fix**: the wheel was built incorrectly but the source code is fine
- **Metadata correction**: wrong description, classifiers, or dependency constraints
- **Documentation-only change**: README or other bundled docs needed updating

## Tag conflict resolution

If `uvr release` detects that a release tag already exists (e.g., you already published `1.2.3`), it will suggest `--post` as one of the resolution options:

```
These tags/releases already exist and would conflict:
  my-pkg/v1.2.3

To resolve, either:
  1. Use --post to publish a post-release:
     my-pkg: 1.2.3.post0
  2. Bump past the conflict:
     uv version 1.2.4.dev0 --directory packages/my-pkg
```

## Workflow

Post-releases are made from the original release tag, not from main. **Do not merge the post-release branch back to main.**

```bash
# 1. Check out the original release tag
git checkout my-pkg/v1.2.3

# 2. Create a post-release branch
git checkout -b post-release/my-pkg/v1.2.3

# 3. Make the fix (code, packaging, metadata, etc.)
# ...

# 4. Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: correct widget parsing in my-pkg"
git push -u origin post-release/my-pkg/v1.2.3

# 5. Publish the post-release
uvr release --post
```

## Merging

The post-release branch is based on an old tag, so pyproject.toml versions will conflict with main — the branch has `X.Y.Z.post1.dev0` while main has `X.Y.Z+1.dev0`.

Two options for getting the fix onto main:

**Option 1: Cherry-pick** (simpler when the fix is small)

```bash
git checkout main
git cherry-pick <fix-commit-hash>    # pick the fix, not the finalize commits
git push
```

**Option 2: Merge and resolve conflicts** (better when the fix touches many files)

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff post-release/my-pkg/v1.2.3
# resolve conflicts: accept main's versions in pyproject.toml and uv.lock
git push
```

Leave the post-release branch as-is after publishing. It serves as a record of the hotfix.

## Tag format

```
my-pkg/v1.2.3.post0
my-pkg/v1.2.3.post1
```
