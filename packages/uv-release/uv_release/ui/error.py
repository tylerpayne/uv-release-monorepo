"""ErrorBlock: red `error:` summary, indented detail rows, and a Fix section.

For *expected* failures the user can act on. The Fix section uses the same
section grammar as the rest of the CLI (`Fix\\n---\\n  cmd`) so users can
copy-paste the next commands. Don't use this for crashes — uncaught
exceptions get Rich's default traceback.
