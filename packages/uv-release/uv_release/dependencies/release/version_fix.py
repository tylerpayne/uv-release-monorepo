"""StripDev: remove .devN suffixes from versions before a non-dev release.

When `uvr release` (without --dev) detects dev versions, the ReleaseGuard
raises a UserRecoverableError carrying this fix Job. The CLI executes the
fix locally with user confirmation, then restarts so the DI container
re-resolves from the updated pyproject.toml versions. Nothing here runs
in CI. The release command never modifies versions itself; it only reads
the current git state and plans from it.

The fix is exactly one shell command: `uvr version --bump stable
--packages <names...>`. That's the same `uvr version` the user could type
themselves, so what we display in the Fix block is what literally runs
when they accept.
